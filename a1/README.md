# Assignment A1

## Summary

The A/B grade class is the Clock hopefully its good enough even though it isn't in a seperate program. I have included a Dockerfile however the Console.Readline() does not pause the process when executing so unfortunately it will throw an mismatch input error.

The Helper class is to remove repetitive behavior or ugly code from Program.cs

## Development Environment

Developed on Archlinux however I did test it on windows.
